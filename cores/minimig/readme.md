### minimig RTG core

This folder contains the latest minimig core for Unamiga Reloaded/ITX. This new core has been completely re-build from the base sources of mininig and then adapted (ported) to use the Unamiga Reloaded features (i2s audio, 24 video dac). The sources of the original core shipped with the Unamiga Reloaded get lost, so we had to rebuilt it from the original sources again and in the meantime, issues with the has been fixed.

The base directory is the old core that was shipped with the Unamiga Reloaded.

The minimig_menu is just the english version of the minimig core menu.

### Instructions for the new core

Place the MINIMIG_b6.ua2 file into the cores (back SD) of your Unamiga Reloaded. Place or replace the file 832OSDAD.bin on the fpga SD.

Also this core requires or better works with Kickstart 3.2 (rename it as kick32.rom), for copyright restrictions we cannot share the kick32.rom here.

See the wiki for screen mode functional keys instructions.
